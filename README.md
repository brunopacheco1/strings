# Strings

RESTFul project for String Set operations, developed in Java EE 7.

Environment:
- Google Compute Engine: g1-small (1 vCPUj, 1.7 GB)
- SO: Ubuntu 14.04, AMI Bitnami Wildfly 11.x
- Java EE 7
- Address: http://apps.bruno-pacheco.eng.br/strings
- Swagger: http://apps.bruno-pacheco.eng.br/strings/api/swagger.yaml

The exercise:

Design and implement REST API supporting the operations described below. Use Java 8 and either Java EE or Play framework. Your backend storage may be non-persistent in-memory storage. Document your API and your code. Write tests. Send the whole package to us with detailed instructions for compilation / deployment. Describe what was the most difficult part of the assignment and why.

Operations to implement:

1. "upload" -- upload a set of strings to the server, verify it's validity (it must be a set, so no duplicate strings are allowed)

2. "search" -- find all the sets containing given string

3. "delete" -- delete a previously uploaded set of strings from the server

4. "statistics" -- return the statistics for one of the previously uploaded sets (number of strings, length of the shortest string, length of the longest string, average length, median length)

5. "most_common" -- find a string which belongs to the largest number of sets; if there are few such strings, return them all, sorted alphabetically.

6. "longest" -- find the longest string in all the sets; if there are few such strings, return them all, sorted alphabetically.

7. "exactly_in" -- find the string which belongs to exactly given number of sets; if there are few such strings, return them all, sorted alphabetically.

8. "create_intersection" â€” create (and add to the server) a new set which is an intersection of two previously uploaded sets

For bonus points (if you want to be considered for senior position):

9. Implement one more operation

"longest_chain" -- from the previously uploaded sets find the longest chain of strings such that:

- every next string starts with the same character as the previous one ends with

- every next string belongs to the same set as previous one, except one jump to another set is allowed

- specific string from specific set may be used only once

Example:

Set 1: foo oomph hgh

Set 2: hij jkl jkm lmn

Set 3: abc cde cdf fuf fgh

The longest chain is: abc - cdf - fuf - fgh - (set changed here) - hij - jkl - lmn

10. Explain what is computational and space complexity of your implementation of "longest_chain" operation

11. Design and implement some kind of stress-testing for your application

Comments about the project:

For JMeter load test, please check test.jmx. It is simple, just a loop of requests to upload sets of strings.

To deploy, nothing especial is necessary, just deploy the project in a Wildfly.

I really enjoyed this challange! I've been working with Java 8 for a short time, lesser with Lambda or functional programming. I have some experience on Scala, during Big Data classes and other personal projects. On this project, I've tryed to use most of the time lambda to practice.

About difficulties, the most difficult one was the service that returns the longest chain. Actually, I didn't figure out the correct meaning of the problem. I've started the development thinking that I was supposed to return the longest chain of all strings uploaded. After reading again the assingment, I've realized the I was wrong, but even so I didn't get the idea of the jumping part. That's the reason you will find in my code both versions of what I've understood.

About computational and space complexity, I'll explain the first idea, the longest chain of all strings uploaded:

To preper the chain index, the computational complexity is O(W\*N), which W is the number of strings in a Set of Strings and N is the number of elements in the Word Index. The Space complexity of this index is O(N\*N!) because the worst result is a tree of N elements, each one combined with N-1 diferent elements.

To search the longest chain in a graph, or its diameter, I've faced some problems. To simplify the project, the software generates all path options and, after that, it choose the longest one according to the number of its vertices. I know that it is the worst option, but I didn't found algorithms on Internet that could help me on that. Actually, I've made some researches about directed graphs and I've found the Directed Acyclic Graph, but I need time to understand it.

ERRATA: I've made some mistakes about space complexity. I've put O(N\*(N!/(N-1)!), but the correct is O(N\*(N!/(N-N)!), or simply  O(N\*N!). For each N element, the worst case is the combination of all N elements, without repetion and the order of the elements matters.
